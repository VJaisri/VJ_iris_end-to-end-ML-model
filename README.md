End-to-End Machine Learning model using python libraries.

The dataset is directly loaded from the library sci-kit.
Splitted the dataset for training and testing.
At the end,imported the algorithm needed to perform that is nothing but logistic regression.

Logistic regression:
  This regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables.
  Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1.
  
 The overall predictive model for iris is deployed through streamlit library in python which helps us to give header,title followed up by giving a user defined function,writing it through the same library after that predicting it by giving various sizes of the iris flower and it will identify the variety of the same.
