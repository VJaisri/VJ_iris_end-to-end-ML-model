End-to-End Machine Learning model using python libraries.

The dataset is directly loaded from the library sci-kit.
Splitted the dataset for training and testing.
At the end,imported the algorithm needed to perform that is nothing but logistic regression.

Logistic regression:
  This regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables.
